        <h4>Section 1: The Bible</h4>
        <p>
          We believe the Bible, comprised of the Old and New Testaments, to be
          the inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God (Matthew 5:18;
          2 Timothy 3:16-17). In faith we hold the Bible to be inerrant in the
          original writings, God-breathed, and the complete and final authority
          for faith and practice (2 Timothy 3:16-17). While still using the
          individual writing styles of the human authors, the Holy Spirit
          perfectly guided them to ensure they wrote precisely what He wanted
          written, without error or omission (2 Peter 1:21).
        </p>

        <h4>Section 2: God</h4>
        <p>
          We believe in one God, who is Creator of all (Deuteronomy 6:4;
          Colossians 1:16), who has revealed Himself in three distinct
          Persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (2 Corinthians 13:14), yet who is
          one in being, essence, and glory (John 10:30). God is eternal (Psalm
          90:2), infinite (1 Timothy 1:17), and sovereign (Psalm 93:1). God is
          omniscient (Psalm 139:1-6), omnipresent (Psalm 139:7-13), omnipotent
          (Revelation 19:6), and unchanging (Malachi 3:6). God is holy (Isaiah
          6:3), just (Deuteronomy 32:4), and righteous (Exodus 9:27). God is
          love (1 John 4:8), gracious (Ephesians 2:8), merciful (1 Peter 1:3),
          and good (Romans 8:28).
        </p>

        <h4>Section 3: Jesus Christ</h4>
        <p>
          We believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is God incarnate,
          God in human form, the expressed image of the Father, who, without
          ceasing to be God, became man in order that He might demonstrate who
          God is and provide the means of salvation for humanity (Matthew 1:21;
          John 1:18; Colossians 1:15). We believe that Jesus Christ was
          conceived of the Holy Spirit and was born of the virgin Mary (Matthew
          1:23); that He is truly fully God and truly fully man (John 1:1,14);
          that He lived a perfect, sinless life (1 John 3:5); that all His
          teachings are true (John 14:6). We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ
          died on the cross for all humanity (1 John 2:2) as a substitutionary
          sacrifice (Isaiah 53:5-6). We hold that His death is sufficient to
          provide salvation for all who receive Him as Savior (John 1:12; Acts
          16:31); that our justification is grounded in the shedding of His
          blood (Romans 5:9; Ephesians 1:7); and that it is attested by His
          literal, physical resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; 1 Peter
          1:3). We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended to Heaven in His
          glorified body (Acts 1:9-10) and is now seated at the right hand of
          God as our High Priest and Advocate (Romans 8:34; Hebrews 7:25).
        </p>

        <h4>Section 4: The Holy Spirit</h4>
        <p>
          We believe in the deity and personality of the Holy Spirit (Acts
          5:3-4). He regenerates sinners (Titus 3:5) and indwells believers
          (Romans 8:9). He is the agent by whom Christ baptizes all believers
          into His body (1 Corinthians 12:12-14). He is the seal by whom the
          Father guarantees the salvation of believers unto the day of
          redemption (Ephesians 1:13-14). He is the Divine Teacher who illumines
          believers&#39; hearts and minds as they study the Word of God (1
          Corinthians 2:9-12). We believe that the Holy Spirit is ultimately
          sovereign in the distribution of spiritual gifts (1 Corinthians
          12:11). We believe that the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, while by
          no means outside of the Spirit&#39;s ability to empower, no longer
          function to the same degree they did in the early development of the
          church (1 Corinthians 12:4-11; 2 Corinthians 12:12; Ephesians 2:20;
          4:7-12).
        </p>

        <h4>Section 5: Angels and Demons</h4>
        <p>
          We believe in the reality and personality of angels. We believe that
          God created the angels to be His servants and messengers (Nehemiah
          9:6; Psalm 148:2; Hebrews 1:14). We believe in the existence and
          personality of Satan and demons. Satan is a fallen angel who led a
          group of angels in rebellion against God (Isaiah 14:12-17; Ezekiel
          28:12-15). He is the great enemy of God and man, and the demons are
          his servants in evil. He and his demons will be eternally punished in
          the lake of fire (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:10).
        </p>

        <h4>Section 6: Humanity</h4>
        <p>
          We believe that humanity came into existence by direct creation of God
          and that humanity is uniquely made in the image and likeness of God
          (Genesis 1:26-27). We believe that all humanity, because of Adam&#39;s
          fall, has inherited a sinful nature, that all human beings choose to
          sin (Romans 3:23), and that all sin is exceedingly offensive to God
          (Romans 6:23). Humanity is utterly unable to remedy this fallen state
          (Ephesians 2:1-5, 12).
        </p>

        <h4>Section 7: Marriage</h4>
        <p>
          We believe that the definition of marriage has already been set by a
          higher authority (God Himself)? In Genesis chapter 2, God declares it
          is not good for Adam (the first man) to live alone. All the animals
          are there, but none of them are a suitable partner for Adam. God,
          therefore, in a special act of creation, makes a woman. Just a few
          verses later, the woman is called “his wife” (Genesis 2:25). Eden was
          the scene of the first marriage, ordained by God Himself. The author
          of Genesis then records the standard by which all future marriages are
          defined: “A man leaves his father and mother and is united to his
          wife, and they become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24). This passage of
          Scripture gives several points for understanding God’s design for
          marriage. First, marriage involves a man and a woman. The Hebrew word
          for “wife” is gender-specific; it cannot mean anything other than “a
          woman.” There is no passage in Scripture that mentions a marriage
          involving anything other than a man and a woman. It is impossible for
          a family to form or human reproduction to take place asexually. Since
          God ordained sex to only take place between a married couple, it
          follows that God’s design is for the family unit to be formed when a
          man and woman come together in a sexual relationship and have
          children. The second principle from Genesis 2 about God’s design for
          marriage is that marriage is intended to last for a lifetime. Verse 24
          says the two become “one flesh.” Eve was taken from Adam’s side, and
          so she was literally one flesh with Adam. Her very substance was
          formed from Adam instead of from the ground. Every marriage thereafter
          is intended to reflect the unity shared by Adam and Eve. Because their
          bond was “in the flesh,” they were together forever. There was no
          escape clause written into the first marriage that allowed for the two
          to separate. That is to say that God designed marriage for life. When
          a man and a woman make a commitment to marry, they “become one flesh,”
          and that is why they say, “Till death do us part.” A third principle
          from this passage about God’s design for marriage is monogamy. The
          Hebrew words for “man” and “wife” are singular and do not allow for
          multiple wives. Even though some people in Scripture did have multiple
          wives, it is clear from the creation account that God’s design for
          marriage was one man and one woman. Jesus emphasized this principle
          when He appealed to the Genesis account to counter the idea of easy
          divorce (Matthew 19:4—6).
        </p>

        <h4>Section 8: Gender (Biological sex)</h4>
        <p>
          We believe we live in a fallen world, and in our fallen state
          confusion ensues and that confusion extends everywhere. We believe in
          God’s design in creation. Fundamental to our understanding of human
          sexuality is that God created two (and only two) genders. The Bible
          cuts through the confusion: “Male and female He created them” (Genesis
          1:27). All the modern-day speculation about multiple genders—or even a
          gender “continuum” with unlimited genders—is unbiblical. An individual
          may claim to be transgender or “gender-fluid,” but that doesn’t
          nullify God’s design and purpose in creating male and female. The
          Bible says that God created “male and female” and He pronounced His
          creation “very good” (Genesis 1:27, 31). God’s plan was perfect, but,
          as with everything in mankind’s sphere, perfection was corrupted by
          sin. Sin negatively impacted the entirety of creation, hurting not
          only humanity&#39;s relationship with God, but with one another and
          the rest of the created order. Our world is fallen, and the effects of
          sin permeate everything. Diseases, birth defects, natural disasters,
          sinful acts, and the negative results of others&#39; sin and our own
          sin can all be traced back to the fall. Sometimes these negative
          effects come in the form of naturally occurring anomalies; other times
          they are more directly traced to specific sin. Could an anomaly
          sometimes occur in gender, physically or mentally? We acknowledge that
          a person can be born with a combination of male and female
          organs—although one’s true, biological sex can be determined through
          medical tests. We believe one of the devil’s ploys is to make us
          dissatisfied with how God made us. We believe that the whole creation
          groans for release from the curse and damage of sin (Romans 8:20–22).
          The ruin wrought by sin is addressed through the redemption of Christ.
          Through salvation, Jesus Christ grants us forgiveness of sin, reverses
          the effect of our poor choices, and compensates for our brokenness. We
          believe some may battle heterosexual temptation, greed, pride, anger,
          or any number of sins. Someone else may battle gender confusion.
          Regardless of the battle with sin and the devil’s lies, Jesus is
          sufficient for any and all of our battles, and He desires to sanctify
          us through His Word of truth (John 17:17). We believe if a person
          feels he or she has been born as the wrong gender, the answer is not
          gender- reassignment surgery, hormone therapy, cross-dressing, etc.
          Those are simply worldly ways of acquiescing to the devil’s lies.
          “Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth” (1
          Corinthians 13:6). And God does not make mistakes. The one who feels
          he or she was born in the wrong body needs, first and foremost, to
          experience the transformative power of Christ. When we “participate
        </p>

        <h4>Section 9: Salvation</h4>
        <p>
          We believe that salvation is a gift of God&#39;s grace through faith
          in the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross (Ephesians 2:8-9).
          Christ&#39;s death fully accomplished justification through faith and
          redemption from sin. Christ died in our place (Romans 5:8-9) and bore
          our sins in His own body (1 Peter 2:24). On the third day after His
          death, Jesus physically rose again, demonstrating His victory over sin
          and death (Romans 14:9). We believe salvation is received by grace
          alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. Good works and obedience
          are results of salvation, not requirements for salvation. Due to the
          greatness, sufficiency, and perfection of Christ&#39;s sacrifice, all
          those who have truly received Christ as Savior are eternally secure in
          salvation, kept by God&#39;s power, secured and sealed in Christ
          forever (John 6:37-40; 10:27-30; Romans 8:1, 38-39; Ephesians 1:13-14;
          1 Peter 1:5; Jude 24). Just as salvation cannot be earned by good
          works, neither does it need good works to be maintained or sustained.
          Good works and changed lives are the inevitable results of salvation
          (James 2).
        </p>

        <h4>Section 10: The Church</h4>
        <p>
          We believe that the Church, the Body of Christ, is a spiritual
          organism made up of all believers of this present age (1 Corinthians
          12:12-14; 2 Corinthians 11:2; Ephesians 1:22-23, 5:25-27). We believe
          in the ordinances of believer&#39;s water baptism by immersion as a
          testimony to Christ and identification with Him, and the Lord&#39;s
          Supper as a remembrance of Christ&#39;s death and shed blood (Matthew
          28:19-20; Acts 2:41- 42, 18:8; 1 Corinthians 11:23-26). Through the
          church, believers are to be taught to obey the Lord and to testify
          concerning their faith in Christ as Savior and to honor Him by holy
          living. We believe in the Great Commission as the primary mission of
          the Church. It is the obligation of all believers to witness, by word
          and life, to the truths of God&#39;s Word. The gospel of the grace of
          God is to be preached to all the world (Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 1:8; 2
          Corinthians 5:19-20).
        </p>

        <h4>Section 11: Things to Come</h4>
        <p>
          We believe in the blessed hope (Titus 2:13), the personal and imminent
          coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to rapture His saints (1 Thessalonians
          4:13-18). We believe in the visible and bodily return of Christ to the
          earth with His saints to establish His promised millennial kingdom
          (Zechariah 14:4-11; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; Revelation 3:10, 19:11-16,
          20:1-6). We believe in the physical resurrection of all human
          beings—the saints to everlasting joy and bliss on the New Earth, and
          the wicked to eternal punishment in the lake of fire (Matthew 25:46;
          John 5:28-29; Revelation 20:5-6, 12-13). We believe that the souls of
          believers are, at death, absent from the body and present with the
          Lord, where they await their resurrection when spirit, soul, and body
          are reunited to be glorified forever with the Lord (Luke 23:43; 2
          Corinthians 5:8; Philippians 1:23, 3:21; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17). We
          believe that the souls of unbelievers remain, after death, in
          conscious misery until their resurrection when, with soul and body
          reunited, they shall appear at the Great White Throne judgment and
          shall be cast into the Lake of Fire to suffer everlasting punishment
          (Matthew 25:41-46; Mark 9:43-48; Luke 16:19-26; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9;
          Revelation 20:11-15).
